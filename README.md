   - Action: Run targeted campaigns that show the unique features of Premium and Standard plans and offer discounts or other incentives to encourage upgrades.

### Conclusion

By focusing on key metrics such as cancellation rates, subscription duration, and revenue by subscription type, businesses can make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Key strategies to implement include:
- Improving Onboarding and Early Engagement: Reducing cancellations by enhancing the first few months of a customer's experience with structured onboarding.
- Developing Loyalty Programs: Retaining long-term subscribers by offering rewards, discounts, or exclusive benefits to those who remain subscribed for extended periods.
